* Overview
This is a toy ray tracer implemented by myself according to the series of books "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" written by Peter Shirley.

* Current functions.
1. This ray tracer support spheres and triangles with materials like _Diffuse_, _Glass_, _Metal_.
2. Use the Bounding Volumes Hierarchies (similar to the kd-tree) to speed up the running time.
3. It also has some small functions that is of my own interests:
  - a progress bar for rendering large model;
  - a simple parser for a simple 3D model file format called ".stl".

* Future directions
The perfomance of this ray tracer is quite bad.
It would be better to levering advanced algorithm like BVH or hardwares like GPU.
 
* Show cases
The following pictures were converted from .ppm files.
